# Automated WareHouse Simulation
 A simplified simulation of a part of an automated warehouse, such as those used by Amazon. 
 The simulation is run in “ticks”: each tick, all the actors will perform a bit of their behaviour. 
 By running one tick after the other, we can see how the warehouse would operate given some parameters.
 
 Currently work in development. Plan on having the final version with a GUI made using JavaFX.
